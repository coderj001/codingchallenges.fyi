# Coding Challenges Solutions Repository
> cpp, make, unix, linux

Welcome to the **Coding Challenges Solutions** repository! This is where I will be posting my solutions to various coding challenges that I take on. Each challenge in this repository is part of my ongoing journey to improve as a software engineer through deliberate practice.

## About

This repository contains solutions to a series of weekly coding challenges, each aimed at helping me (and you!) develop a deeper understanding of different programming languages, frameworks, and technologies. The challenges are designed to be practical, often inspired by real-world tools and utilities.

The goal of this repository is to showcase my solutions to these challenges. If you're looking to learn from my approach, compare solutions, or explore different methods to tackle common coding problems, you've come to the right place!

## Repository Structure

Each challenge's solution will be housed in its own folder or file and will typically include:

- **Challenge Overview**: A brief description of the challenge, including its purpose and any background context.
- **Solution Code**: The implementation of the solution to the challenge.
- **Testing Instructions**: Instructions on how to test the solution or run it in your own environment.
- **Thought Process**: A breakdown of how I approached the problem, including any interesting discoveries, challenges, or optimizations made along the way.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine to explore my solutions:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coderj001/codingchallenges.fyi.git
   ```
2. **Browse through the challenges** and check out the code solutions for each one.
3. **Learn and Experiment**: Feel free to adapt the code to your needs, experiment with different solutions, or improve upon what I've written.
4. **Test Solutions**: If testing instructions are provided, run the solutions locally to see them in action.

## Contributing

This repository primarily serves as a personal collection of solutions, but if you have suggestions or improvements to the challenges or their solutions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request with your ideas.

## Feedback

I welcome any feedback! If you have suggestions for improving the solutions, want to discuss a specific approach, or have questions about the challenges themselves, don't hesitate to reach out.
